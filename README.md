# Linear-Regression-
Linear Regression is an algorithm that belongs to supervised Machine Learning. It tries to apply relations that will predict the outcome of an event based on the independent variable data points. The relation is usually a straight line that best fits the different data points as close as possible.

**Steps :-

1. Set learning rate and number of iterations, initiate random weight and bias value.

2. Build liner regression equation (y = wx + b).

3. Find the y^pred value for given x value for corresponding weight and bias.

4. Check the loss function for these parameter value ( difference between y^pred and y^true ).

5. Update the parameter value using gradient descent (new weight and bias value).

6. Step 3,4,5 are repeated till we get minimum loss function.

7. Finally we will get the best model (best weight and bias value) as it has the minimum loss function.
